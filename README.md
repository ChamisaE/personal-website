## PWP Milestone 1 Feedback
Great work - purpose, audience, goal, and persona are well-defined and detailed. Beyond the surface, I can definitey see the opportunities you wish to create for future clients of yours. I look forward to your content strategy and design concepts in the upcoming milestones.

Your project files are set up to spec and code looks good. Your Milestone 1 passes at <a href="https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/">Tier III</a>. You are now clear to begin work on Milestone 2Î±.

## Milestone 2a Feedback
Super job on your Milestone 2a! Your wireframes are beautiful and will definitely translate into a great, simple personal website. I like the background graphic you used and the clear, well-designed menu at the top. It makes sense as a responsive mobile-first design. Your content strategy matches with the persona defined.

Since part of your Milestone 2a got turned in after the deadline, but everything else looks good, your Milestone 2a passes at a Tier II. Nice job!
